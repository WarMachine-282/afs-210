1.) For this project you will create a simple media player that will use Data structure(s) to store a playlist of songs with the following functions. (Note: Your media player program WILL NOT actually play any songs)
- Add songs to a playlist
- Remove songs from a playlist
- Play the current selected song, default is the first song on the playlist
- Skip to the next song on the playlist. If at end of list, restart from the beginning
- Go back to the previous song on the playlist.  If at the start, go back to the end of the list.
- Search for a song by song name
- Randomly shuffle the song list
2.) Create your own algorithm to randomly sort the data structure you have chosen to use.  This algorithm does not need to be efficient.
4.) Download the file “mediaplayer.py  Download mediaplayer.py” to your week 7 folder.
5.) Edit mediaplayer.py and complete the code for each of the menu choices
- You can ONLY use the following data structures covered in this class
- Linked Lists (Singly or Doubly)
- Stacks and Queues
- Graphs
- Trees
5.) You CANNOT use a third party library or code written by someone else outside of class.
- Preload your playlist with at least six songs of your choice
- Test your code to ensure that all of the menu options are working as expected
